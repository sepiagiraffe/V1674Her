To use the functions the following packages are **required**:
    #these are required for reading the files, plotting, and some of the analysis functions

    astropy, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, math, sys
    
    
    for a more detailed list, and how to import them:

    from astropy.wcs import WCS
    from astropy import wcs
    from astropy.io import fits, ascii
    from astropy.coordinates import Angle, SkyCoord
    from astropy.nddata import Cutout2D
    from astropy.modeling import models, fitting
    from astropy import time
    
    import astropy.units as un
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd

    from matplotlib.patches import Ellipse, Rectangle, Arc
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
    from matplotlib.ticker import MultipleLocator, FixedFormatter
    from matplotlib.ticker import FormatStrFormatter
    from matplotlib.legend_handler import HandlerTuple
    from matplotlib.lines import Line2D

    import sys
    import math


The following are **recommended**:
    from astropy.constants import mu0 #this one is required for magnetic pressure

    #these are required for print statements involving latex formatting, currently are required but is a WIP
    
    from Ipython.display import display, Math
    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore");
